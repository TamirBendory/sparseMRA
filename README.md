# sparseMRA

This repository contains the scripts Gen_Fig1, Gen_Fig2a, and Gen_Fig3 to reproduce the figures in the paper "SPARSE MULTI-REFERENCE ALIGNMENT: SAMPLE COMPLEXITY AND COMPUTATIONAL HARDNESS" by Tamir Bendory, Oscar Mickelin, and Amit Singer. It also contains auxiliary functions that are needed to implement the expectation-maximization, bispectrum inversion, and semidefinite programming (SDP). 

For the SDP, one needs to download CVX http://cvxr.com/
For the bispectrum inversion, one needs to download manopt https://www.manopt.org/
